## Getting Started

Ansible role for any-sync daemons. Currently, this works on Debian and RHEL based linux systems. Tested platforms are:
* Ubuntu 22.04
* Amazon Linux 2

You can read the documentation on using any-sync [here](https://tech.anytype.io/).

### Prerequisites

* Minimum Ansible v2.11 recommended
* [Redis with Bloom module](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom)
* MongoDB (version ‚â•6 recommended)
* S3 object storage: AWS S3 or self-hosted solution (for example [minio](https://github.com/minio/minio))

### Installing

Clone the current repository with roles

```
git clone https://github.com/anyproto/ansible-anysync.git
```

Use the playbook:

```
ansible-playbook any-sync.yml
```

## Usage

1. To start, fill in the account information and network configuration in the `group_vars/any_sync.yml` file, replacing the example data with your own.
2. Define the structure of your any-sync cluster in the `inventory.yml` file.
3. You can then make changes to the configuration of each any-sync-* daemon by editing its respective `default/main.yml` inside each role.

‚ö†Ô∏è Use [any-sync-tools](https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync-tools) to generate account and network configuration.
