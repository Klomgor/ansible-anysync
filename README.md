## Getting Started

Ansible role for any-sync daemons. Currently, this works on Debian and RHEL based linux systems. Tested platforms are:
* Ubuntu 22.04
* Amazon Linux 2

You can read the documentation on using any-sync [here](https://tech.anytype.io/).

### Prerequisites

* Minimum Ansible v2.11 recommended
* **x1** [Redis with Bloom module](https://github.com/RedisBloom/RedisBloom)
* **x1-3** MongoDB (version ‚â•6 recommended) in Replica Set mode
* S3 object storage: AWS S3 or self-hosted solution (for example [minio](https://github.com/minio/minio))

### Installing

Clone the current repository with roles

```
git clone https://github.com/anyproto/ansible-anysync.git
```

Use the playbook:

```
ansible-playbook any-sync.yml -i inventory.ini
```

## Usage

1. Define the structure of your any-sync cluster in the `inventory.ini` file. Minimum **x3 any-sync-node and x1 nodes of other types**, and also **x1 Redis** and **x1-3 MongoDB** in Replica Set mode. If not using AWS S3, specify **Minio server** address.
2. Generate using [any-sync-tools](https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync-tools/blob/main/any-sync-network/README.md) and then copy `networkId`(from client.yml file) of your network and `peerId, peerKey, signingKey` for each any-sync-* account. Paste this data into the `group_vars/any_sync.yml` file on the appropriate lines, replacing example data.
3. You can then make configuration changes to each any-sync-* daemon by editing the corresponding `default/main.yml` within each role. The latest production versions of any-sync components are available [here](https://puppetdoc.anytype.io/api/v1/prod-any-sync-compatible-versions/). Remember to change the MongoDB and Redis URLs if required.
4. Import into your client app `client.yml` file that you should have created during generation in step 2.
